# This is how I started this blog

Last Saturday I read about a live stream on YouTube about a new PyTorch course on FreeCodeCamp:
["Deep Learning with PyTorch - Free Six Week Course"](https://youtu.be/vo_fUOk-IKk).

I did some Deep Learning with [fast.ai](fast.ai) 2 years ago and was a bit reluctant to start a new engagement. I do have already a lot to do with Swift and building my portfolio for iOS development, but I gave it a go and watched the first 2 hours.  

I am impressed that 3500 people joined and more than 1000 were watching the live stream from all around the world. One of the reasons I joined, is maybe because of the sense of community?

The first assignment is to create a blog post. I could blog on Medium but I prefer to have more control over my posts so I created a new webpage just for this course.

I have to thank Jeremy Howard from fast.ai for providing the resources. ðŸ™Œ

It took me literally 5 minutes to set up a new account on GitHub to use their hosting feature: Pages. And another 5 to use the script provided in the article to get my blog up and running. It is incredible.  
I can already start blogging and complete my assignment!

Here's the table of contents:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

And a numbered list:

1. item 1

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

## Code

General preformatted text:

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
