# What is a tensor?

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type. (Wikipedia)

One of the key things to understand about tensors its that they require all their elements to have a single data type (also called dtype). They require also their data to be in a regular shape, it means regularity has to be mantained.
Simply explained tensors is a container for data, which can be a number,  a vector or a n-dimensional array.
In Machine Learning Tensors are an important data structure and can be thought of generalisation of scalars, vectors and matrices elements and can be easily understood as a multidimensional array.
"In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor.”("Deep Learning" (Goodfellow et al.) 
A scalar is zero-order tensor or rank zero tensor. A vector is a one-dimensional or first order tensor, and a matrix is a two-dimensional or second order tensor.
Shape is a property of the tensors, it gives us the length along each dimension. A tensor with a scalar will have a shape of zero! One array of 5 element will have as shape one element: 5. A matrix will have 2 elements rows and columns as shape property ex [2, 3]
Difference between a tensor and a matrix? A matrix has to have two dimensions. We can say a matrix is a special type of tensor but a tensor is not a matrix

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2
