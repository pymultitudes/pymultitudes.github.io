# This is how I started this blog

Last Saturday I read about a live stream on YouTube about a new PyTorch course on FreeCodeCamp:
["Deep Learning with PyTorch - Free Six Week Course"](https://youtu.be/vo_fUOk-IKk)

I did some Deep Learning with [fast.ai](fast.ai) 2 years ago and was a bit reluctant to start a new engagement. I do have already a lot to do with Swift and building my portfolio for iOS development, but I gave it a go and watched the first 2 hours of the course. 

I am impressed that 3500 people joined and more than 1000 were watching the live stream from all around the world. One of the reasons I joined, is maybe because of the sense of community?

The first assignment is to create a blog post. I could blog on Medium but I prefer to have more control over my posts so I created a new webpage just for this course.

I have to thank Jeremy Howard from fast.ai for providing the resources. ðŸ™Œ

It took me literally 5 minutes to set up a new account on GitHub to use their hosting feature: Pages. And another 5 to use the script provided in the article to get my blog up and running. It is incredible.
I can already start blogging and complete my assignment for the course!
