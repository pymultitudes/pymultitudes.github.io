# How to use jupyter notebooks with vs code


VS Code is a great platform. It is very easy to get started with their excellent support for Jupiter notebooks. As you can see from the screenshot they support dark mode and even have markdown support. The notebook looks really good and can be executed locally.

I quote from the VS Code documentation (link is below) :

> [Jupyter](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (formerly IPython Notebook) is an open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a **notebook**. Visual Studio Code supports working with Jupyter Notebooks natively, as well as through [Python code files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py).


### Create a new folder and set up the environment

Let's start creating a new folder on your Mac or PC and name it ‘Developer’ or what you like. Then change your current directory to the folder with `cd` as below:

```bash
mkdir Developer
cd Developer
```

When working with Python, to select your environment is really important. 

Check your python version with:

```bash
which python3
```

You will need Python3 for everything that has to do with deep Learning. Best is the latest version of Python (3.8).

For every project we create an environment which will allow us to download packages and dependencies in a sandboxed way, this mean that it will not conflict with other versions of python or other packages that we already have in our system.  
This can be a life saver and is extremely recommended to avoid 'dependancy hell'.
We create the environment from the command line:

```bash
python3 -m venv <your env name>
```

For example this was the command for me. I called my environment jupyter_env

```bash
python3 -m venv jupyter_env
```

Then you need to activate it:

```bash
source jupyter_env/bin/activate
```
It will be quite empty when created.  
You can check the packages which are in your environment:

```bash
pip list
```

Usually you need to upgrade pip
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

and download the necessary packages for your project:

```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
pip install jovian --upgrade
pip3 install torch torchvision
```

### Select ther environment in VS Code

In VS Code open the folder as a project with `File/Open` or `File/Open Workspace`.  

Start to work in the VS Code editor selecting your environment.

To select an environment, use the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the `Command Palette (⇧⌘P)`. And select the environment you just created which will have the environment name in it.

### The jupyter notebooks

Open the terminal in VS Code with `Terminal/New Terminal`.  

Launch a local server with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```



This will create a local server and give you the link of the notebook to open it in your browser. Form there you can edit the cells and run your code.

I hope this was helpful. Many people use the Conda package to run notebooks, but the package is a few GBs in size and most people will not need all the functions. This is an easy way to get started, and VS Code is a very powerful and customisable editor.

### Jovian.ml

If you use Jovian, go to a notebook, fork it to your profile and click on clone. This will copy a command line command to your clipboard. 
Paste this in your terminal after have activated your environment. On the Jovian website you will need the API key to sync the changes. Yoiu can run the notebook locally and then sync it to your jovian repo with:

```bash
# this if not already installed
!pip install jovian --upgrade --quiet
import jovian
# update with your filename
jovian.commit(filename="Introducing-PyTorch-tensor", environment=None)
# you will be prompted for the API Key
```

Here's the table of contents:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
