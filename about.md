Hello and welcome to my blog.

## About


>  “In the beginning there was nothing, which exploded.”

I am a Junior developer with a lot of enthusiasm to learn more. I just finished my two years-long "Umschulung" for Software Developer in Berlin and got certified by the IHK, the German Chamber Of Commerce, in January 2020. 

My preferred languages include Swift, C, C++, JS. I also love Python! I attended the online courses on Artificial Intelligence offered by Jeremy Howard of [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) and by the [Helsinki University](https://www.elementsofai.com). 

I love specialty coffee and on the weekends you might see me on my bike going to look for nice filter coffee places in Berlin.
